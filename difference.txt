if im using await, the code will run synchronously. and when it comes to the await operation, it will run the called function synchronously and wait until the await operation completed then the code will continue to the next line of code. after all the operation is done, it will show the resopnse. if im not using await to call the loop function, the code will still run synchronously, but when it comes to the looping part, it will not wait untill the process is complete. its still call the first iteration then keep continue the progress to the next line of code and even showing the result instantly. but because that looping has 2 second delay each iteration, theres still operation running in the background, so eventho the result is already show up, the looping still running with 2s delay each iteration
